1. Write a C program that calculates the average of marks got by a student in three subjects ie Physics, Chemistry, Math...assume for each subject, four different tests were conducted; assignment, Course work, mid term and end of term exams.

short notes about the program.
The program initializes arrays for storing marks in Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics, along with variables to keep track of the total and average marks.
It prompts the user to enter marks for each of the four assessments (assignment, coursework, mid-term, end-of-term) in Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics.
It calculates the total marks for each subject by summing the input marks.
The program computes the average marks for each subject by dividing the total marks by the number of assessments which are four.
It calculates the overall average of the three subjects' average marks.
Finally, it prints the overall average to the user.


2. Write a C program that accepts a group of N domestic animals and a group of X wild animals. Your program should print N + X animals after entering each group.

short notes about the program.
The program starts by asking the user to input the number of domestic and wild animals they know.
It then creates two arrays to store the names of these animals. one array is for domestic and the other one wild animals.
The program then prompts the user to input the names of the domestic animals and stores them in the first array. It does the same for wild animals and stores them in the second array.
Lastly the program prints out all the names of the domestic and wild animals that the user entered.
